> [!IMPORTANT]
>### Thank You for Your Support!
>We deeply appreciate your willingness to contribute to translating DSX. Your efforts help make DSX more accessible to a wider audience.

> [!WARNING]
> DSX Translations have moved to Localazy, checkout Getting Started below to find out how to access!
> 
> I was able to import the translations that were previously done, so this should make it much easier, and since now translations is paid, it has easier access to suggestions from Machine Translations like:
>- Amazon Translate
>- Google Translate
>- Azure Translate
>- DeepL translation
>- Shared Translation suggestions which suggest other projects that have the same string of text and what they used.
>
> Please let me know if you have any questions. I appreciate anyone taking their time to help translate DSX to make it more accessible to your communities.
