# Translate DSX

### Thank You for Your Support!

We deeply appreciate your willingness to contribute to translating DSX. Your efforts help make DSX more accessible to a wider audience.

## Getting Started

1. Download the [en-US.yml](https://github.com/Paliverse/DSX/blob/main/Translations/en-US.yml) file from the repository.
2. Rename the file to match your language and country.
3. Translate the text after the colon for each key.

**Updating Existing Translations:** 

Already translated language files are added above to be updated if needed.

## Translating
For example:
```yaml
NoControllerDetected.Title: No Controllers Detected
```
In this example, "No Controllers Detected" is what you would translate.

**Note:** Updates to the `en-US.yml` file will be visible [here](https://github.com/Paliverse/DSX/commits/main/Translations/en-US.yml).

**New Translations:** Any new translation keys will be added to the bottom of the `en-US.yml` file to make it easier for new items to be translated. So check regularly for new updates. If you have the Translator role in the discord server, you will be notified of new changes.

## Submitting Your Translation

Once you've completed the translation:

- Reach out to me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PUThpCFByn) in the `dsx-v3-translation` channel.
- Alternatively, you can message me directly on Discord @paliverse.

Your translated file will be reviewed and added to DSX to benefit users in your language community.
